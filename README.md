## About 

This is a project that I did as part of the following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/. If you are interested I highly recommend checking it out, as it has proven to be very insightful and easy to follow so far.

## Installation

No installation is needed for this. The app itself can be run directly from the URL, and if you want to fiddle with the code you can just clone it to your local drive.

## Usage

Fair use.
